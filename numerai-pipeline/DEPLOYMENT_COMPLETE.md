## 🚀 Usage Commands

### Production Operations
```bash
# Run robust pipeline in production
./robust_pipeline.py

# Deploy with full testing
./simple_deploy.sh

# Run tests only
./run_tests.sh
```

### Backup & Recovery
```bash
# Create backup
./backup_rollback.sh backup

# List backups
./backup_rollback.sh list

# Health check
./backup_rollback.sh health

# Rollback (if needed)
./backup_rollback.sh rollback <backup_name>
```

## 🌐 Service Endpoints
